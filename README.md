Navigate to server\ and client\ directories, using these commands:
```
cd ..
```
```
cd server
```
```
cd client
```
From now we call ./server/ terminal as server terminal and ./client/ as client terminal.
On server terminal, run:
```
python manage.py runserver
```
On client terminal, run:
```
npm run dev
```

If run successfully, your web is hosted at http://localhost:5173/. The main page is the http://localhost:5173/login page, which you will be redirected shortly.
